    

      <p>Professionally, I’ve worked across academia, policy research, and applied data science. My past roles include conducting fieldwork and interviews in Haifa for my MENA-focused thesis, co-authoring policy reports for the Institute for National Security Studies in Tel Aviv, and serving as a Graduate Student Instructor at the University of Michigan. I’ve also held editorial and communications roles with international organizations, where I applied data storytelling to amplify regional insights.</p>

      <p>I am fluent in English, Hebrew, Modern Standard Arabic, and Mandarin Chinese, and have intermediate proficiency in Levantine Arabic. My technical skills include Python, R, SQL, LaTeX, as well as libraries and frameworks such as Transformers, spaCy, XGBoost, and Streamlit. I’m experienced in regression modeling, time series analysis, topic modeling, clustering techniques, and causal inference.</p>

      <p>I’ve been honored with several fellowships and research awards, including the Rackham International Research Award, MIRS Fellowship, and the Mahfoud Bennoune Memorial Thesis Award. These experiences have shaped my interdisciplinary training and deepened my commitment to leveraging data for social insight and policy relevance.</p>
